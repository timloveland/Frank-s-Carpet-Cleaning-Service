# Frank-s-Carpet-Cleaning-Service
This is a coding challenge for Dr. Frank Mitropoulos' course in C++.  
This program uses constant variables to calculate the total cost of a service for two different service options.

By asking the user for how many hypothetical rooms they want cleaned, the program calculates the cost of having
the number of rooms, entered by the user, cleaned by the charge fee, which is programmed to be $25 for a small room
and $35 for a large room.
